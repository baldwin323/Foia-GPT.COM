1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. It will also contain the id names of the DOM elements that may be used by any JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain the custom styles for the website. It will use class and id names that are referenced in the "index.html" file. It will also import the "tailwind.css" file to use its styles.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. It will be imported into the "styles.css" file and its classes will be used in the "index.html" file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are the unique identifiers for the HTML elements in the "index.html" file. They are used in the CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css") to apply styles to the specific elements.

2. CSS Class Names: These are the identifiers for the styles in the CSS files. They are used in the "index.html" file to apply the styles to the HTML elements.

3. CSS Import: The "styles.css" file will import the "tailwind.css" file. This allows the styles from Tailwind to be used in the "styles.css" file and subsequently in the "index.html" file.

4. HTML Link Tags: The "index.html" file will use link tags to include the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. This allows the styles from these files to be applied to the HTML elements in the "index.html" file.
